I am a second year Masterâ€™s student studying Computer Science at Columbia University. I work as a research assistant, advised by Professor Shuran Song at the Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab. I also actively collaborate with Professor Steven Feiner at the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics. I am broadly interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent systems to learn from their interactions with the physical world and subsequently, acquire novel & complex skills that can effectively assist humans.

Before joining Columbia, I obtained my integrated B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.

You can find more details about me at https://shreeyajain.github.io/, or simply reach out to me at shreeya.jain@columbia.edu.
