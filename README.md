### ✨Hi there✨

I am a Robotics Software Engineer at [GrayMatter Robotics](http://graymatter-robotics.com/), where I help develop smart, easy to use, and rapidly deployable robots for high-mix manufacturing operations. Prior to joining GMR, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University and an integrated B.E. in Computer Science with M.Sc. in Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. At Columbia, I worked as a research assistant advised by [Professor Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/) at the [Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab](https://cair.cs.columbia.edu/). I also actively collaborated with [Professor Steven Feiner](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/) at the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics. I am broadly interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent systems to learn from their interactions with the physical world and subsequently, acquire novel & complex skills that can effectively assist humans.
